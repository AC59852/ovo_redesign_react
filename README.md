# OVO Redesign

## Introduction
OVO Redesign is a fan collaboration project to redesign the OVO store website for a more modern, appealing <br>
and logical presentation. The site was created by myself and <a href="http://www.patrickbradley.me">Patrick Bradley</a>, <br>
with no set deadline, and no budget.

## Philosphy
We believed that OVO as a company, product, brand, etc, all revolve around Drake as it's face and personality.
<br>
We decided to make the approach more similar to what you might see on a Drake album cover, or a thumbnail with OVO and him.
<br>
Tonally, we took the colours that resembles Drake's brand and figure more: Gold, red, dark grays, black, and used them as the brand colours.
<br>
We also used minimal but striking imagery, simple to understand navigation, and light functionality.

## Tech
For this piece of work, I decided to use React as the front-end framework, mockapi.io as the data mockup, and tailwind as a CSS framework.
<br>
I chose this software because I wanted to branch out from my norm of Vue, Vue Router, SASS, etc. I was very happy with the result, using
<br>
multiple methods to generate content and load pages, using packages that help with simple transitions and with routing. The syntax is a bit
<br>
tricky to get used to, coming directly from Vue and no in between, but the product came out great and I am very satisfied.

## Usage
Because this is a fan remake, there is nothing to hide, and is not meant for any sort of publicity, profit or recognition.
<br>
We believe in creative expression, and we love certain brands, so we combined those two aspects and wanted to create something for what we enjoy, for no particular reason other than that. To view this site, visit <a href="https://ovo-redesign.web.app/">OVO-Redesign</a> to check it out.
